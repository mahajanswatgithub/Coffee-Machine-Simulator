## OOPS Concepts Used
In the Coffee Machine Simulator code provided, several Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts have been utilized. Here are the OOP concepts used in the implementation:

1.Classes and Objects:

- The **`CoffeeMachine`** class represents the coffee machine and encapsulates its state and behavior.
- The **`Main`** class contains the main method and serves as the entry point of the program.

2.Encapsulation:

- The **`CoffeeMachine`** & **`Coffee`** class encapsulates the internal state of the coffee machine, such as the amounts of water, milk, coffee beans, and money.
